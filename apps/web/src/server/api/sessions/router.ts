/**
 * Sessions sub-router (Phase 6 of the 3-tier migration — issue #317).
 *
 * Thin façade over `SessionService` — same shape as the cronjobs / tasks
 * routers. Service-level domain errors are translated to tRPC error codes
 * here so the service tier stays framework-agnostic.
 *
 * The legacy `sessionsRouter` in `apps/web/src/trpc/router.ts` is replaced
 * by this file and the corresponding key is dropped from the legacy router
 * in the same diff per the migration invariant in
 * `server/api/router.ts`.
 *
 * Why this surface is small (and why most "session" reads don't go through
 * here): the chat-events stream (`apps/web/src/api/chat-events.ts`) covers
 * JSONL backfill, gap-fill replay, and live tail in a single subscription.
 * The legacy `sessions.messages` query was deleted with the chat-event-log
 * refactor (see `docs/experiments/chat-event-log.md`). All that remains
 * here is the explicit "list past sessions for this chat pane" read.
