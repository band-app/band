 * Infra tier — owns the persistence concerns for the workspace domain:
 *
 *   - The `worktrees` table (rows synthesizing the one-worktree-per-branch
 *     model on top of git worktrees).
 *   - Per-workspace branch status (`branch_statuses` — git/CI columns
 *     driven by `branch-status-poller`).
 *
 * `workspace_statuses` rows (agent name/status/summary) are still co-managed
 * by the agent lifecycle in `lib/state.ts`; only the workspace-delete-side
 * cleanup lives here so the service layer can drive a workspace removal
 * through a single object. Promoting the rest of `workspace_statuses` into
 * this class is in scope for a follow-up alongside the agent / task tier
 * migration.
 *
 * NOTE: today's worktrees-table writes still go through the whole-tree
 * `saveState` rewrite in `lib/state.ts` (it deletes + reinserts the
 * `projects` + `worktrees` tables together inside one transaction). That
 * persistence model belongs to the projects domain and is owned by Phase 2
 * (`ProjectQueries`, issue #313); until that ships, the workspace service
 * continues to call `loadState`/`saveState` for the table mutations and
 * this class only exposes the read-side and the status-table cleanup paths
 * the service needs.
